# Design Document

## Overview

SPIDER is a contractor marketplace platform built with modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience for customers, contractors, and back-office staff. The system implements a unique Random Match algorithm, milestone-based project management, and comprehensive dashboards for all user types.

The platform follows a microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation between public-facing content, user portals, and administrative functions, while maintaining a unified user experience.

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization System

**JWT-based Authentication:**

- Access tokens (15 minutes) and refresh tokens (7 days)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Magic link authentication for contractors
- 2FA for admin and back-office users

**User Roles & Permissions:**

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  VISITOR = 'visitor',
  CUSTOMER = 'customer',
  CONTRACTOR = 'contractor',
  COORDINATOR = 'coordinator',
  SALES = 'sales',
  ADMIN = 'admin',
}

interface Permission {
  resource: string;
  actions: ('create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete')[];
}
```

#### 2. Random Match Engine

**Matching Algorithm:**

- Service type compatibility scoring
- Geographic proximity calculation (radius-based)
- Contractor availability checking
- Rating and success rate weighting
- Budget range alignment
- Workload balancing

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface MatchCriteria {
  serviceType: string;
  location: GeoPoint;
  budget: BudgetRange;
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  customerPreferences?: ContractorPreferences;
}

interface MatchResult {
  contractors: ContractorMatch[];
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string[];
}
```

#### 3. Milestone Management System

**Milestone Workflow:**

- Quote approval triggers milestone creation
- Automatic status progression with manual overrides
- Payment integration with milestone completion
- Customer and contractor notifications

**Status Flow:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

### Database Schema Relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--|| UserProfile : has
    User ||--o| Contractor : "can be"
    Contractor ||--o{ PortfolioItem : has
    Contractor ||--o{ ContractorService : offers

    Lead ||--o{ LeadAssignment : generates
    LeadAssignment }o--|| Contractor : assigned_to
    Lead ||--o| Job : becomes

```

## Error Handling

### Error Categories and Responses

**Validation Errors (400):**

- Form validation failures
- Business rule violations
- Invalid request parameters

**Authentication Errors (401/403):**

- Invalid or expired tokens
- Insufficient permissions
- Account verification required

**Business Logic Errors (422):**

- Contractor unavailable for matching
- Milestone progression violations
- Payment processing failures

**System Errors (500):**

- Database connection failures
- External service timeouts
- Unexpected application errors

### Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

### Retry and Fallback Strategies

**Critical Operations:**
